  Bhijn & Myr:
  - bugfix: You can no longer attach multiple tracking beacons to a single mech, fixing
      an exploit where mechs can be nuked with minimal effort.
  - bugfix: Omegastation's airmix filter is no longer inverted! The oxygen:nitrogen
      levels of Omega later in the round should now be normal again.
  - rscadd: 'The TGS bot is now capable of pinging the reboot role! Rejoice! tweak:
      The TGS bot''s automated output can now be configured to define which channels
      certain messages are output to.'

      your choosing queued up for playback on the jukebox!
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes can now be emagged, allowing you to boost their volume up to
      210%, along with removing all of its access restrictions. Additionally, a sufficiently
      loud jukebox is fully capable of causing potentially permanent damage to your
      ears.
  - rscadd: 'Jukeboxes now support multi-z! This is self-explanatory. tweak: Volume
      knobs now work on jukeboxes! tweak: Muffled jukeboxes have been given a buff.
      tweak: Sounds now factor in the distance multiplier for their baseline z offset.
      tweak: SOUND_UPDATE now bypasses the can_hear() check in playsound_local() (thanks
      Azarak for helping figure this out!)'
  - bugfix: 'Jukebox audio no longer uses playsound_local(), allowing falloff to properly
      apply to jukeboxes (this fixes the bug where they were significantly quieter
      than intended) tweak: When deaf, jukeboxes no longer mute the playing track
      permanently.'
  - bugfix: Ears are capable of taking damage again.
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes have been added to Boxstation, Lambdastation, Metastation, and
      Omegastation

  - bugfix: Mechs now use power when moving.
  - bugfix: The check for mining-only mechs is no longer inverted to only allow non-mining
      z levels.
  - bugfix: Reverted an accidental buff from the /tg/ mech code port and its adjustment
      to citadel's mech state.
  - bugfix: 'Mechs with different base movement power cost now actually have it apply
      instead of immediately being overwritten. tweak: Adjusted part impact on movement
      power use to make more sense.'

  timothyteakettle:
  - rscadd: 'optimises quirks somewhat tweak: nyctophobia will now stop run intent
      when you try to move in darkness with it on, compared to the old behaviour of
      automatically turning it off in darkness when it is on and you have been in
      darkness for >= 0.2 seconds tweak: nyctophobia and lightless will both not update
      your mood until you move now, as part of the optimisations made by changing
      them to tg code'

  Bhijn & Myr:
  - rscadd: The station minimap now features higher detail! Instead of just windows
      and grilles being outlined, all dense+anchored structures and machinery are
      shown on the minimap.
  - rscadd: The station minimap now supports obfuscating entire areas, via the minimap_show_walls
      var.
  - rscadd: 'The station minimap now supports defining two area colors, allowing for
      a checkerboard pattern! tweak: Hallways and maint have been given white and
      gray colors, respectively, for ease of readability. tweak: Ruins are now obfuscated
      on the minimap, and have been given a subtle, yet distinct, color pattern!'
  - bugfix: The station minimap no longer errors when you mouse over it
  - rscadd: 'The station minimap now supports multiz! (However, due to bugginess,
      multiz minimaps won''t display area tooltips.) tweak: The station minimap now
      features pixel-perfect scaling.'
  - code_imp: The station minimap can now support managing data for up to 16,581,374
      areas without any conflicts at all! Before, BYOND's psuedorandom RNG meant that
      it was somewhat common for areas to collide with each others' data.
  - rscadd: Talking is now accompanied with fully-customizable sounds! You can modify
      your character's speech under the speech tab in chargen, and you can toggle
      these sounds via the "Hear/Silence Vocal Barks" verb under the preferences tab!
      This also fully supports genetics.
  - bugfix: Admittedly an unatomized change, but Cit's DNA blocks can now properly
      be updated through genetics. Before, these required a complete genetics reset
      to apply.

      self-checking, and mood checkups, have all been converted to make use of blockquotes.'
  Bhijn & Myr (+ UI work and cleanup by Sandpoot!):

  - tweak: The default mode for colormates is now HSV coloration
  - tweak: The temp messages in colormates have been tweaked slightly to be more user-friendly,
      as they're user-facing.
  - tweak: The description for constants in the colormate matrix mode has been fixed;
      the constant variables have nothing to do with contrast, they simply add color
  - tweak: Matrix mode has been made a lot more usable; it's now clamped between -10
      and 10, and features a step of 0.01, making it much easier to simply click and
      drag to adjust the values, rather than having to punch them in manually
  Putnam3145:
  - balance: QCD matter is now worth 10x as much and makes 2 research pointer per
      mole
